react-go
========

The game of [Go][1] implemented with [React][2]. Check out a [live preview][3] 
or [read the tutorial][4]. Running the demo locally requires a static file
server. The easiest way to do that is to execute `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
from the root directory and visit `localhost:8000` from your browser.
